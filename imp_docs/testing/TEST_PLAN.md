# nano-Grazynka Test Plan
**Last Updated**: January 18, 2025
**Version**: 4.3
**Status**: UPDATED - Configuration Fixes Applied & 100% Pass Rate Achieved

## üö® CRITICAL TEST ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### Pre-Test Checklist (MANDATORY)
1. **Frontend MUST run via Docker** - NOT `npm run dev`
   - ‚úÖ Use: `docker compose up frontend` (maps to port 3100)
   - ‚ùå DON'T: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (runs on wrong port 3000)
2. **Backend may need restart** after code changes
   - Run: `docker compose restart backend` if routes return 404
   - Watch for SQLite disk I/O errors - restart backend if they occur
3. **Correct API endpoints**:
   - Upload: `POST /api/voice-notes/upload`
   - Get single: `GET /api/voice-notes/:id`
   - List: `GET /api/voice-notes?sessionId=xxx`
   - Delete: `DELETE /api/voice-notes/:id`
   - Migration: `/api/anonymous/migrate` (NOT `/api/auth/migrate-anonymous`)
   - Anonymous usage: `/api/anonymous/usage/:sessionId`
4. **Frontend routes (IMPORTANT)**:
   - Note detail: `/note/{id}` (SINGULAR, not `/notes/{id}`)
   - Library: `/library`
   - Dashboard: `/dashboard`

### Test Data Location
**CRITICAL**: All test files are located in the `tests/test-data/` directory, NOT in the project root.
- **Correct Path**: `tests/test-data/` (relative from project root)
- **Absolute Path**: `/Users/pawelwiacek/Documents/ai_agents_dev/nano-grazynka_CC/tests/test-data/`
- **Files Available**:
  - `zabka.m4a` - Polish audio file (451KB)
  - `zabka.mp3` - Polish audio file (MP3 format)
  - `test-audio.mp3` - English audio file
  - `test-file.txt` - Text file for invalid upload tests
- **IMPORTANT**: ALL TESTS MUST BE RUN FROM PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY
- **Script Usage**: When running from root, use `tests/test-data/filename`

### Pre-Test Configuration Validation
Before running any tests, verify:
- [ ] Test files exist in `tests/test-data/` directory
- [ ] Docker services are running (`docker compose ps`)
- [ ] Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3100
- [ ] Backend is accessible at http://localhost:3101
- [ ] Migration endpoint path is `/api/anonymous/migrate` (NOT `/api/auth/migrate-anonymous`)
- [ ] All test scripts use correct relative paths to test data

## Test Execution Guide

Each test suite below can be executed individually. Run tests in order from Suite 1 to Suite 13 for best results.

### Quick Start - Running All Tests
To run all test suites, execute the commands listed in each suite section below, or use the complete sequential list at the bottom of this document.

**Important**: All commands should be run from the project root directory.

### Known Playwright MCP Limitations
**File Upload Issue**: Playwright MCP cannot maintain file chooser modal state between tool calls.

**Technical Explanation**: 
- Playwright MCP tools are atomic operations - each tool call is independent
- File chooser modal is a browser state that exists between the `click` and `file_upload` actions
- When `browser_click` completes, the tool returns and the modal state is lost
- The subsequent `browser_file_upload` call cannot access the already-closed modal

**Workaround - Hybrid Testing Pattern**:
```javascript
// ‚ùå DOESN'T WORK - Modal closes between calls
await mcp__playwright__browser_click(element: "upload button")
await mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload(paths: ["/path/to/file"])  // Fails

// ‚úÖ WORKS - Use API for file upload
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url: "http://localhost:3100")
// Navigate UI with Playwright MCP
const uploadResponse = await axios.post('/api/voice-notes/upload', formData)
// Verify results with Playwright MCP
await mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url: `/note/${noteId}`)
```

**Testing Matrix**:
| Test Type | Tool to Use | Reason |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Navigation | Playwright MCP | Works perfectly for page navigation |
| Button Clicks | Playwright MCP | Works for all non-file buttons |
| Form Input | Playwright MCP | Works for text inputs, dropdowns |
| File Upload | API (axios) | Modal state limitation |
| Verification | Playwright MCP | Works for checking results |

## üö® CRITICAL: Use Playwright MCP Server for ALL E2E Testing

**MANDATORY TESTING APPROACH:**
- ‚úÖ **USE**: Playwright MCP server tools (`mcp__playwright__*`)
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Install npm Playwright packages
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Run `npm install @playwright/test`
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Create test files with `require('@playwright/test')`

The Playwright MCP server is already configured in the Docker environment.
All browser automation MUST use MCP tools directly (except file uploads - use API).

## Test Strategy Overview

### Testing Levels
1. **L1: Backend API Tests** - Direct API testing (existing scripts)
2. **L2: Frontend E2E Tests** - UI automation with **Playwright MCP Server** (NOT npm packages)
3. **L3: Integration Tests** - Full stack user journeys using **Playwright MCP**
4. **L4: Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing

### Test Environment
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3100
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3101
- **Database**: SQLite at /data/nano-grazynka.db
- **Test Data**: zabka.m4a (Polish), test-audio.mp3 (English)

### Suite 13: YAML Prompt System Tests (20 min)
**Purpose**: Validate externalized prompt system with variable interpolation

| Test ID | Test Case | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Y13.1 | PromptLoader initialization | Loads prompts.yaml successfully |
| Y13.2 | YAML parsing and validation | Valid YAML structure parsed correctly |
| Y13.3 | Variable interpolation - entities | {{entities.*}} placeholders replaced |
| Y13.4 | Variable interpolation - project | {{project.*}} placeholders replaced |
| Y13.5 | Variable interpolation - user | {{user.customPrompt}} passed through |
| Y13.6 | Hot-reload in development | Prompts reload on file change |
| Y13.7 | Fallback to defaults | Uses hardcoded prompts if YAML missing |
| Y13.8 | Template resolution | Gemini templates load correctly |
| Y13.9 | WhisperAdapter integration | Transcription uses prompts.yaml |
| Y13.10 | LLMAdapter integration | Summarization uses prompts.yaml |
| Y13.11 | TitleGenerationAdapter integration | Title generation uses prompts.yaml |
| Y13.12 | Malformed YAML handling | Graceful error on invalid YAML |
| Y13.13 | Missing variables handling | Empty string for undefined variables |
| Y13.14 | Nested variable paths | Supports {{entities.people.detailed}} |
| Y13.15 | End-to-end prompt flow | Upload ‚Üí Transcribe ‚Üí Summarize with YAML |

**Execute:**
```bash
# YAML prompt system testing
# Test prompt interpolation
node tests/scripts/archive/test-prompt-interpolation.js

# Check PromptLoader initialization
docker compose logs backend | grep PromptLoader

# Verify prompts.yaml is loaded
cat backend/config/prompts.yaml
```

## Common Test Issues & Solutions

### Known Issues
1. **SQLite Disk I/O Errors**
   - **Symptom**: 500 errors during upload, "disk I/O error" in logs
   - **Solution**: Restart backend container: `docker compose restart backend`
   - **Root Cause**: Transient SQLite locking issues in Docker volumes

2. **Session ID Mismatches**
   - **Symptom**: 403 Forbidden on delete, empty results on list
   - **Solution**: Ensure same session ID used for upload and subsequent operations
   - **Prevention**: Use test-utils.js helper functions for consistent sessions

3. **Wrong Route Paths**
   - **Symptom**: 404 on `/notes/{id}` frontend routes
   - **Solution**: Use `/note/{id}` (singular) not `/notes/{id}` (plural)
   - **Prevention**: Reference test-utils.js for correct route patterns

4. **Playwright MCP File Upload**
   - **Symptom**: Cannot maintain file chooser modal between tool calls
   - **Solution**: Use API-based uploads for testing file operations
   - **Prevention**: Hybrid approach - UI navigation with Playwright, uploads with API

5. **Backend Not Reflecting Code Changes**
   - **Symptom**: Routes return 404 after code updates
   - **Solution**: `docker compose restart backend`
   - **Prevention**: Always restart backend after significant changes

6. **Test File Location Errors**
   - **Symptom**: ENOENT errors when running tests
   - **Solution**: Use `../../test-data/` path from `tests/scripts/`
   - **Prevention**: All test files must be in `tests/test-data/` directory

7. **Migration Endpoint Path**
   - **Symptom**: 404 error on `/api/auth/migrate-anonymous`
   - **Solution**: Use correct path `/api/anonymous/migrate`
   - **Prevention**: Check endpoint documentation in API contract

```yaml
# NO JS FILES! Use MCP tools directly:
1. Navigate to app:
   mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url: "http://localhost:3100")

2. Click upload area:
   mcp__playwright__browser_click(element: "Click to upload", ref: "e24")

3. Upload file:
   mcp__playwright__browser_file_upload(paths: ["/path/to/zabka.m4a"])

4. Click process button:
   mcp__playwright__browser_click(element: "Upload and Process", ref: "e36")
