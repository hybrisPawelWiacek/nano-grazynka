# nano-Grazynka Test Plan
**Last Updated**: August 15, 2025
**Version**: 4.0
**Status**: UPDATED - AI Features & Bug Fix Tests Added

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Use Playwright MCP Server for ALL E2E Testing

**MANDATORY TESTING APPROACH:**
- ✅ **USE**: Playwright MCP server tools (`mcp__playwright__*`)
- ❌ **DO NOT**: Install npm Playwright packages
- ❌ **DO NOT**: Run `npm install @playwright/test`
- ❌ **DO NOT**: Create test files with `require('@playwright/test')`

The Playwright MCP server is already configured in the Docker environment.
All browser automation MUST use MCP tools directly.

## Test Strategy Overview

### Testing Levels
1. **L1: Backend API Tests** - Direct API testing (existing scripts)
2. **L2: Frontend E2E Tests** - UI automation with **Playwright MCP Server** (NOT npm packages)
3. **L3: Integration Tests** - Full stack user journeys using **Playwright MCP**
4. **L4: Performance Tests** - Load and stress testing

### Test Environment
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3100
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3101
- **Database**: SQLite at /data/nano-grazynka.db
- **Test Data**: zabka.m4a (Polish), test-audio.mp3 (English)
