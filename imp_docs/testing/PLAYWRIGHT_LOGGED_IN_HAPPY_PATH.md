# Playwright Logged-In User Happy Path Test

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide for testing the complete logged-in user flow using Playwright MCP. This "happy path" test verifies user registration, authentication, and all features available to authenticated users including credit tracking and custom prompt regeneration with flexible JSON.

**For MCP tool reference and troubleshooting, see [Playwright MCP Playbook](../../collaboration/PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_PLAYBOOK.md)**

## Test File Location
- **Test Audio File**: `/Users/pawelwiacek/Documents/ai_agents_dev/nano-grazynka_CC/tests/test-data/zabka.m4a`
- **Application URL**: `http://localhost:3100`

## Prerequisites
1. Application running: `docker compose up`
2. Playwright MCP server enabled in Claude
3. Test file `zabka.m4a` exists in the test-data directory

## Test Steps

### 0. Clear Session State (CRITICAL)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Start with clean browser state
// Navigate to the application first
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
  url: "http://localhost:3100"

// Clear ALL localStorage to ensure no session conflicts
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate
  function: () => {
    localStorage.clear();
    sessionStorage.clear();
    console.log('Browser storage cleared - starting fresh');
    return { cleared: true };
  }
```

### 1. Create Unique User Account
```javascript
// Navigate to registration page
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
  url: "http://localhost:3100/register"

// Generate unique email with timestamp to avoid conflicts
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate
  function: () => {
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    const email = `testuser_${timestamp}@example.com`;
    console.log('Creating user with email:', email);
    return { email, timestamp };
  }

// Fill registration form with unique email
mcp__playwright__browser_type
  element: "Email address textbox"
  ref: [find textbox with name "Email address"]
  text: [use generated email from above]

// Enter password
mcp__playwright__browser_type
  element: "Password textbox"
  ref: [find textbox with name "Password"]
  text: "TestPassword123!"

// Confirm password
mcp__playwright__browser_type
  element: "Confirm Password textbox"
  ref: [find textbox with name "Confirm Password"]
  text: "TestPassword123!"

// Submit registration
mcp__playwright__browser_click
  element: "Sign up button"
  ref: [find button with text "Sign up"]

// Wait for redirect to dashboard/home after successful registration
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for
  time: 3
```

### 2. Verify Logged-In State
```javascript
// Should be redirected to home page after registration
// Verify user is logged in by checking for logout button
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot
// Look for:
// - "Logout" button in navigation
// - "Credits: X / 5" indicator (Free tier starts with 5 credits)
// - User email or profile indicator

// Verify localStorage has auth token
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate
  function: () => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');
    const userId = localStorage.getItem('userId');
    console.log('Auth token present:', !!token);
    console.log('User ID:', userId);
    return { hasToken: !!token, userId };
  }
```

### 3. Upload Voice Note as Logged-In User

13. âœ… **Entity Search/Filter**: Filter by type and search by name
14. âœ… **Bulk Selection**: Multiple entities can be selected with checkboxes
15. âœ… **Project Badges**: Entities show which projects they belong to
16. âœ… **Three-dot Menu**: Edit, Manage Projects, Delete actions work

### Project Management Success Criteria
17. âœ… **Project Creation**: Create projects with name, description, and entities
18. âœ… **Entity Association at Creation**: Select entities when creating project
19. âœ… **Project Selector**: Dropdown shows all projects plus "New Project"

3. **Credit Limits**: Free tier has 5 credits, test may fail if exceeded
4. **Session Persistence**: Auth token should persist across page navigation
5. **Processing Times**: Allow sufficient time for AI operations

## Debugging Tips

### Check User Creation
```javascript
// Verify unique email was generated
mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages
// Look for "Creating user with email: testuser_[timestamp]@example.com"
```

### Verify Authentication State
```javascript
// Check auth headers in API calls
mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests
// Look for Authorization headers with Bearer token
```

### Check Database for User
```bash
# Verify user was created in database
sqlite3 data/nano-grazynka.db "SELECT id, email, tier FROM User WHERE email LIKE 'testuser_%';"

# Check user's notes
sqlite3 data/nano-grazynka.db "SELECT id, userId, title FROM VoiceNote WHERE userId = '[user-id]';"
```

### Monitor Backend Logs
```bash
# Watch for authentication and user creation
docker compose logs backend --tail=50 | grep -E "user|auth|register"
```

## Automation Script

For future automation, this test can be converted into a Playwright test script:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/logged-in-happy-path.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Logged-In User Happy Path', () => {
  test('should complete full logged-in user flow', async ({ page }) => {
    // 1. Create unique user
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    const email = `testuser_${timestamp}@example.com`;
    const password = 'TestPassword123!';
    
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3100/register');
    await page.fill('input[name="email"]', email);
    await page.fill('input[name="password"]', password);
    await page.fill('input[name="confirmPassword"]', password);
    await page.click('button:has-text("Sign up")');
    
    // 2. Wait for redirect and verify logged in
    await page.waitForURL('http://localhost:3100');
    await expect(page.locator('button:has-text("Logout")')).toBeVisible();
    
    // 3. Upload file
    const fileInput = await page.locator('input[type="file"]');
    await fileInput.setInputFiles('tests/test-data/zabka.m4a');
    await page.click('button:has-text("Upload and Process")');
    
    // 4. Wait for processing
    await page.waitForURL(/\/note\//);
    
    // 5. Generate summary
    await page.click('button:has-text("Summary")');
    await page.click('button:has-text("Generate Summary")');
    await page.waitForSelector('[data-summary-content]');
    
    // 6. Test custom prompt
    await page.click('button:has-text("Regenerate")');
    await page.fill('textarea', 'provide just 2 sentence summary');
    await page.click('button:has-text("Regenerate Summary")');
    
    // 7. Verify flexible JSON response
    const summaryText = await page.textContent('[data-summary-content]');
    const sentences = summaryText.split('.').filter(s => s.trim());
    expect(sentences.length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(3); // 2 sentences + possible partial
    
    // 8. Check library
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3100/library');
    await expect(page.locator('text=/notes in your collection/')).toBeVisible();
    
    // 9. Logout
    await page.click('button:has-text("Logout")');
    await page.waitForURL(/\/(login|$)/);
  });
});
```
