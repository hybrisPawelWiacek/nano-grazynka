### Suite 5: Performance Tests ⏭️ NOT EXECUTED
**Reason**: Focus on functional testing first

### Suite 6: Edge Cases ⏭️ NOT EXECUTED  
**Reason**: Time constraints

## Critical Issues Found

### P1 (Critical) Issues
1. **API Route Instability** - Upload endpoint returns 404 after backend restart
   - **Impact**: Breaks file upload functionality
   - **Workaround**: Restart backend container
   - **Root Cause**: Likely route registration timing issue

### P2 (Major) Issues
1. **Anonymous Session Headers** - Frontend doesn't consistently send x-session-id
   - **Impact**: Anonymous users can't track their uploads
   - **Location**: Frontend API client
   - **Fix Required**: Add session headers to all API calls

2. **Test Script Organization** - Nested tests/scripts/tests directory
   - **Impact**: Confuses test execution
   - **Fix Required**: Flatten directory structure
