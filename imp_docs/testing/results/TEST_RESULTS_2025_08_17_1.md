| F4A.2 | Anonymous file upload | ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED | Playwright MCP file upload issue |
| F4A.3-6 | Remaining tests | ‚è∏Ô∏è SKIPPED | Blocked by upload issue |

### Technical Issues with Playwright MCP
- File upload modal interaction not working properly
- Path resolution issues between MCP server and local filesystem
- Alternative: API-based testing confirms upload functionality works

## Critical Issues Found

### üî¥ P1 - High Priority
1. **Anonymous Auth Endpoint (404)**: `/api/auth/migrate-anonymous` endpoint missing or misconfigured
2. **Playwright MCP File Upload**: File chooser modal not properly handled by MCP tools

### üü° P2 - Medium Priority  
1. **Frontend Port Mismatch**: Frontend runs on 3000 but docs say 3100
2. **Test Data Location**: Test files scattered, need organization

### üü¢ P3 - Low Priority
1. **Console Errors**: 401 errors on initial page load (expected for anonymous)
2. **Next.js Config Warning**: Invalid `swcMinify` option

## Verified Working Features

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality
- User registration and authentication
- JWT-based session management  
- Anonymous session creation
- File upload (via API)
- Transcription processing (Whisper)
- Polish language support
- English language support
- Voice note storage and retrieval
- Database persistence

### ‚úÖ API Contract Compliance
- Proper nested response structures
- Consistent field naming
- Error handling and status codes

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Anonymous Migration Endpoint**: Implement missing `/api/auth/migrate-anonymous` endpoint
2. **Standardize Port Configuration**: Update frontend to use port 3100 consistently
3. **Organize Test Files**: Create proper test directory structure

### Testing Improvements
1. **Playwright Alternative**: Consider using direct API testing for file uploads
2. **Test Data Management**: Centralize test files in `tests/test-data/`
3. **Automated Test Runner**: Create comprehensive test suite runner

### Documentation Updates
1. Update port numbers in documentation (3000 vs 3100)
2. Document Playwright MCP limitations for file uploads
3. Add troubleshooting guide for common test failures

## Test Artifacts

### Test Files Created
- `/tests/scripts/test-auth-suite.js` - Comprehensive auth testing
- `/imp_docs/testing/TEST_RESULTS_2025_08_17.md` - This report

### Test Data Used
- `zabka.m4a` - Polish audio test file (451KB)
- `test-audio.mp3` - English audio test file

## Conclusion

The nano-Grazynka MVP demonstrates **core functionality is working** with successful:
- ‚úÖ Backend services operational
- ‚úÖ Authentication system functional
- ‚úÖ File upload and processing working (via API)
- ‚úÖ Transcription pipeline operational

However, there are **critical gaps** that need addressing:
- ‚ùå Anonymous to user migration not implemented
- ‚ùå Frontend E2E testing blocked by tool limitations
- ‚ùå Some API endpoints missing or misconfigured

### Overall Assessment: **PARTIAL PASS**
The system is functional for basic use cases but requires fixes for complete feature coverage.

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix identified P1 issues
2. Re-run failed test suites
3. Complete integration and performance testing
4. Update documentation with test results
