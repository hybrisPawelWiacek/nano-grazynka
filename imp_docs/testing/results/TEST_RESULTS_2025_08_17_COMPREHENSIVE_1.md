## Critical Failures Analysis

### 1. Upload Processing Error (P1 - CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Frontend upload endpoint returns 500 error
**Impact**: Core functionality completely broken
**Error Details**: 
- Endpoint: POST /api/voice-notes
- Session ID present: Yes
- File data present: Yes
- Response: 500 Internal Server Error

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Route appears to be `/api/voice-notes` but should be `/api/voice-notes/upload`
- Possible multipart form handling issue in backend

### 2. Library Loading Error (P1 - CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Cannot load voice notes list
**Impact**: Users cannot view their uploaded notes
**Error Details**:
- Endpoint: GET /api/voice-notes
- Response: 500 Internal Server Error

### 3. Session Migration Error (P2 - HIGH)
**Issue**: Anonymous session migration fails on registration
**Impact**: Anonymous users lose their data when registering
**Error Details**:
- Migration endpoint called but fails
- Error: "Failed to migrate session"

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P1)
1. **Fix Upload Endpoint**: 
   - Verify route mapping for `/api/voice-notes/upload`
   - Check multipart form data handling
   - Review error logging in backend

2. **Fix Library Endpoint**:
   - Debug `/api/voice-notes` GET handler
   - Check session ID validation logic
   - Review database query errors

3. **Fix Session Migration**:
   - Debug migration endpoint logic
   - Ensure user creation and session transfer are atomic
   - Add proper error handling

### Follow-up Actions (P2)
1. Add comprehensive error logging
2. Implement retry mechanisms for uploads
3. Add integration tests for critical paths
4. Improve error messages for users

## Test Environment Issues

### Known Problems
1. **SQLite Disk I/O Errors**: Intermittent database locking issues
2. **Backend Route Changes**: Routes not reflecting code updates without restart
3. **Playwright MCP Limitations**: Cannot maintain file chooser state

### Workarounds Applied
1. Used API-based testing for file uploads
2. Restarted backend container when needed
3. Hybrid approach: UI navigation + API uploads

## Conclusion

The application has **critical issues** that prevent core functionality from working:
- Upload processing is completely broken
- Library viewing is non-functional
- Session migration fails

**Recommendation**: DO NOT DEPLOY until P1 issues are resolved.

### Next Steps
1. Fix critical upload and library issues
2. Re-run failed test suites
3. Add automated regression tests
4. Implement monitoring for production
