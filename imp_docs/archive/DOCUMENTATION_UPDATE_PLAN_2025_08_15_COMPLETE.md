# Documentation Update & Project Status Analysis Plan
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation restructuring and accurate project status assessment

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a two-phase approach to restructure documentation for better clarity and maintain accurate project status. The key principle is separation of concerns: PRD contains specifications only, PROJECT_STATUS tracks implementation and roadmap, and planning documents detail specific work items.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (100%)
- **Core Functionality**
  - Voice upload and transcription (Whisper API)
  - Summarization (Gemini 2.0 Flash + GPT-4o fallback)
  - Export (JSON/Markdown)
  - Language support (English/Polish with auto-detection)
  
- **Authentication & User System**
  - JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies
  - User registration and login
  - Anonymous sessions (5 free transcriptions)
  - Session migration to registered user
  - Credit system and usage tracking
  
- **Recent Enhancements**
  - AI-generated titles and descriptions
  - Audio duration extraction and display
  - Custom prompt regeneration
  - Content formatting with markdown
  - Library page with search/filter
  
- **Infrastructure**
  - Test suite (200+ test cases across 12 suites)
  - Docker containerization
  - Basic observability (implemented but disabled)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

#### 1. **Multi-Model Transcription (70% Complete)**
**What's Built:**
- Backend fully supports both models (transcriptionModel field)
- Frontend has model toggle (Smart/Fast buttons)
- Cost estimator component exists
- Gemini transcription with extended prompts working

**What's Missing (30%):**
- Template selector UI (Meeting/Technical/Podcast)
- Token counter visualization (224 token limit for GPT-4o)
- Template variable placeholder system

#### 2. **Deployment Infrastructure (60% Complete)**
**What Exists:**
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production compose configuration
- Detailed Coolify deployment plan document
- Uses existing `Dockerfile` (not optimized for production)

**What's Missing:**
- `backend/Dockerfile.prod` - Optimized production image
- `frontend/Dockerfile.prod` - Optimized production image
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment automation script
- `scripts/backup-sqlite.sh` - Database backup script

#### 3. **Observability (40% Complete)**
**What Exists:**
- `LangSmithObservabilityProvider` class implemented
- `OpenLLMetryObservabilityProvider` class implemented
- Config schema includes observability settings
- Environment variables configured

**What's Not Working:**
- Both providers have `enabled: false` hardcoded (line 11)
- Never tested in production
- No verification of data flow to external services

### üéØ Unimplemented Features (0%)

#### Priority Features (MVP)
1. **Dashboard Page** - Currently mocked/placeholder
2. **Settings Page** - Currently mocked/placeholder
3. **Reprocessing History** - Chat-like version tracking (PRD line 445)
4. **YAML Prompt Configuration** - System prompt customization (PRD line 446)

#### Quick Wins
1. **Toast Notifications** - Replace console.log with user notifications
2. **Header UI Alignment** - Consistent headers across all pages
3. **README Updates** - Document auth and anonymous features

#### Post-MVP (Classified by PM)
1. **Audio Playback** - Play audio in note details
2. **Password Reset** - Full email-based flow with user profile management

## Two-Phase Documentation Restructuring

### PHASE 1: Accurate Status Documentation

#### 1A. Create This Planning Document
**Location**: `imp_docs/planning/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN_2025_08_15.md`  
**Purpose**: Capture complete analysis and restructuring plan

#### 1B. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md Structure
Create clear sections:
```markdown
## Implementation Log
### August 2025
- ‚úÖ AI-generated names and metadata
- ‚úÖ Duration display feature
- ‚úÖ Custom prompt regeneration fix
[etc...]

## Current Development Phase
### Active: Multi-Model Transcription (70% ‚Üí 100%)
**Timeline**: 2-3 days
**Missing**: Template UI, token counter, variable placeholders

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 1: Complete Multi-Model (Aug 16-18)
### Phase 2: Dashboard/Settings (Aug 19-22)
### Phase 3: Quick Wins (Aug 23-24)
### Phase 4: Reprocessing History (Aug 25-27)

## Planning Documents
- [This Plan](./imp_docs/planning/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN_2025_08_15.md)
- [Archived Plans](./imp_docs/archive/)
```

#### 1C. Clean PRD_ACTUAL.md
**Remove**:
- All "Status: ‚úÖ Complete" markers
- Implementation percentages
- "Current Implementation Status" sections

**Keep**:
- Feature specifications
- Business requirements
- User stories
- Technical requirements

**Fix Specifically**:
- Line 26: Change from "üéØ Ready for Implementation" to pure specification
- Remove implementation status from all feature sections
- Move all status information to PROJECT_STATUS.md

### PHASE 2: Documentation Structure Separation

#### 2A. Requirements Context (PRD_ACTUAL.md)
**Purpose**: Pure specification document
- Feature descriptions
- Business logic requirements
- API specifications
- NO implementation details

#### 2B. Implementation Context (PROJECT_STATUS.md)
**Purpose**: Implementation tracking
- Completed features with dates
- Work in progress
- Roadmap and priorities
- Links to planning documents

#### 2C. Collaboration Context (Optional Reorganization)
**Current Structure**:
- `/CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions
- `/imp_docs/playbook/MCP_PLAYBOOK.md` - MCP server usage

**Proposed Structure** (Optional):
```
/collaboration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md (moved from root)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCP_PLAYBOOK.md (moved from imp_docs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PAIR_PROGRAMMING.md (extracted from CLAUDE.md)
```

## Development Priorities (Per PM Direction)

### Immediate (MVP)
1. **Complete Multi-Model Transcription** (30% remaining)
2. **Dashboard/Settings Pages** (full implementation)
3. **Quick Wins** (toast notifications, YAML prompts, UI alignment)
4. **Reprocessing History** (versioning system)
5. **Enable Observability** (activate and test providers)

### Post-MVP
- Audio Playback
- Password Reset with user profile management
- Email notifications
- Advanced user preferences

## Key Documentation Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - PRD = What to build (specifications)
   - PROJECT_STATUS = What's built (implementation)
   - Planning Docs = How to build (detailed plans)

2. **Accuracy**
   - Reflect true implementation state
   - Don't mark partially done as complete
   - Track percentage completion for in-progress items

3. **Traceability**
   - Link planning docs from PROJECT_STATUS
   - Archive completed plans
   - Maintain implementation dates

## Success Metrics

- [ ] PRD contains only specifications (no status)
- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS accurately reflects all implementations
- [ ] Clear roadmap for remaining work
- [ ] All planning documents properly linked
- [ ] Observability status documented
- [ ] Deployment gaps identified

## Next Actions

1. Execute Phase 1 documentation updates
2. Archive completed planning documents
3. Update README with missing features
4. Create specific plan for Multi-Model completion
5. Document observability activation steps

*This plan ensures clean, robust documentation with clear separation between specifications and implementation status.*
