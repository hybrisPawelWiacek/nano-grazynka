# MVP Release 1 Plan - Minimal Viable Launch

**Created**: January 16, 2025  
**Timeline**: 5 days (after YAML and Entity systems)  
**Status**: Planning Complete  
**Dependencies**: To be executed AFTER YAML Prompt System and Entity-Project System

## Important Note

This plan assumes completion of:
1. **YAML Prompt System** (3 days) - Foundation for prompt management
2. **Entity-Project System** (4-5 days) - Knowledge management for better transcription

The scope and requirements may need revision based on learnings from those implementations.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working
- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Login/logout flow  
- Anonymous user support with migration to registered accounts
- Core transcription and summarization (GPT-4o + Gemini)
- MockStripe payment endpoints configured
- Observability 90% complete (LangSmith + OpenLLMetry enabled)
- Voice note library with AI-generated titles
- Usage tracking and credit system

### ‚ùå What's Missing/Broken for MVP
- Dashboard displays mock data instead of real usage statistics
- Settings page has placeholder functionality
- No user-facing way to upgrade to Pro tier
- Missing payment success/cancel pages
- No connection between payment and tier upgrade

## Features Deliberately Excluded from Release 1

These features are important but not essential for initial launch:

| Feature | Reason for Exclusion | Target Phase |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Audio Playback | Nice-to-have, not core to transcription | Post-Release 1 |
| Reprocessing History | Advanced feature, adds complexity | Post-Release 1 |
| Email System | Can launch without email notifications | Release 2 |
| Password Reset (Email) | Simplified version exists | Release 2 |
| Advanced Settings | Not needed for basic usage | Release 2 |
| Data Export | Privacy feature, not MVP critical | Release 2 |
| Account Deletion | Can handle manually initially | Release 2 |

## Success Criteria for Release 1

The MVP is considered complete when:

1. ‚úÖ **User Registration & Auth**
   - Users can register with email/password
   - Users can login and logout
   - Sessions persist across page refreshes

2. ‚úÖ **Core Functionality** 
   - Users can upload audio files
   - Transcription and summarization work
   - Results are saved and viewable

3. üîÑ **Usage Tracking** (To implement)
   - Dashboard shows real usage data
   - Credit limits are enforced
   - Monthly reset works

4. üîÑ **Payment Flow** (To implement)
   - Users can upgrade to Pro tier
   - Payment updates tier and limits
   - MockStripe integration works end-to-end

5. üîÑ **Basic Account Management** (To implement)
   - Users can view their account info
   - Users can see their current plan
   - Users can upgrade their account

## Technical Considerations

### Database Queries Needed
- Dashboard stats aggregation
- Recent voice notes query
- Usage tracking updates
- Tier upgrade logic

### API Endpoints to Verify/Create
- GET /api/dashboard/stats (create)
- GET /api/user/settings (verify)
- POST /api/payments/webhook (verify)

### Frontend Routes to Create
- /payment/success
- /payment/cancel

### Environment Variables to Verify
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (MockStripe)
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (MockStripe)
- FRONTEND_URL (for redirects)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Payment integration issues | Use MockStripe for Release 1, real Stripe later |
| Complex dashboard requirements | Show only essential metrics |
| Settings page scope creep | Strictly limit to 5 listed features |
| Testing delays | Create automated test script on Day 5 |

## Post-Release 1 Roadmap

After successful Release 1, prioritize:
1. **Week 1**: Monitor user feedback and fix critical bugs
2. **Week 2**: Implement email system for password reset
3. **Week 3**: Add audio playback feature
4. **Week 4**: Begin reprocessing history feature

## Definition of Done

Release 1 is complete when:
- [ ] All essential features are implemented
- [ ] Complete user journey test passes
- [ ] No critical bugs remain
- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS.md is updated
- [ ] Basic documentation exists
- [ ] MockStripe payment flow works

## Notes

- This plan prioritizes launching quickly with core features
- User feedback will guide post-Release 1 priorities
- MockStripe allows testing payment flows without real money
- The 5-day timeline assumes no major blockers

*This plan will be revisited after completing the YAML Prompt System and Entity-Project System implementations, as those may impact requirements or reveal new insights.*
