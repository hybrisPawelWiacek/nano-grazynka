# MCP Server Best Practices for nano-grazynka

## Project-Specific MCP Usage Guidelines

This document outlines how to effectively use MCP servers for developing nano-grazynka, your voice note transcription and summarization MVP.

## üéØ Core Development Servers

### 1. Serena (Code Analysis & Navigation)
**When to use:**
- Exploring the codebase structure without reading entire files
- Finding symbol definitions (classes, functions, methods)
- Refactoring code across multiple files
- Understanding dependencies between components

**Best practices for nano-grazynka:**
```
# Find transcription-related code
Use: serena.find_symbol("TranscriptionService")
Use: serena.search_for_pattern("whisper|transcription")

# Navigate domain models efficiently
Use: serena.get_symbols_overview("/backend/src/domain/entities/VoiceNote.ts")

# Track code changes
Use: serena.write_memory("audio_processing_flow", "Description of how audio flows through the system")
```

**DON'T:**
- Read entire files when you only need specific functions
- Use file reading for code when symbolic tools are available

### 2. Memory (Project Context)
**When to use:**
- Storing architectural decisions
- Tracking processing optimization findings
- Recording API integration patterns
- Maintaining test scenarios

**Best practices for nano-grazynka:**
```
# Store transcription API configurations
memory.create_entities([{
  name: "whisper-api-config",
  entityType: "configuration",
  observations: ["Using OpenRouter for Whisper", "25MB file limit", "Supports EN/PL"]
}])

# Track performance insights
memory.create_entities([{
  name: "audio-processing-performance",
  entityType: "optimization",
  observations: ["Chunking improves latency", "Parallel processing for multiple files"]
}])
```

### 3. Context7 (Documentation)
**When to use:**
- Looking up Next.js App Router patterns
- Finding Fastify middleware documentation
- Researching Prisma query optimizations
- Understanding Docker Compose configurations

**Best practices for nano-grazynka:**
```
# Get Next.js file upload documentation
context7.get_library_docs("/vercel/next.js", topic="file-upload")

# Research Prisma transactions for voice note saving
context7.get_library_docs("/prisma/prisma", topic="transactions")

# Find Fastify streaming patterns for audio
context7.get_library_docs("/fastify/fastify", topic="streams")
```

### 4. GitHub Official (Version Control)
**When to use:**
- Creating feature branches for new functionality
- Opening PRs for code review
- Tracking issues for bugs/features
- Managing releases

**Best practices for nano-grazynka:**
```
# Create feature branch
github.create_branch("feature/batch-audio-upload")

# Open PR with comprehensive description
github.create_pull_request(
  title="Add batch audio upload support",
  body="## Changes\n- Multi-file upload UI\n- Queue processing\n- Progress tracking\n\n## Testing\n- Unit tests for queue\n- E2E for upload flow"
)

# Track processing issues
github.create_issue(
  title="Audio files >20MB fail silently",
  labels=["bug", "transcription"]
)
```

## üî¨ Research & Problem-Solving Servers

### 5. Perplexity Ask (Latest Best Practices)
**When to use:**
- Researching current audio transcription APIs
- Finding optimal chunking strategies
- Understanding LLM prompt engineering for summarization
- Investigating accessibility standards for voice apps

**Example queries for nano-grazynka:**
```
"What are the latest Whisper API optimization techniques for 2024?"
"Best practices for handling Polish language transcription"
"How to implement progressive audio upload with Next.js"
"Optimal prompts for extracting action items from transcripts"
```

### 6. Sequential Thinking (Complex Problem Solving)
**When to use:**
- Designing the audio processing pipeline
- Optimizing database schema for version history
- Planning E2E test scenarios
- Architecting the reprocessing workflow

**Example usage for nano-grazynka:**
```
Thought 1: Analyze current audio flow from upload to storage
Thought 2: Identify bottlenecks in transcription pipeline
Thought 3: Design queue system for parallel processing
Thought 4: Implement progress tracking mechanism
Thought 5: Verify solution handles edge cases
```

### 7. Firecrawl (Web Research)
**When to use:**
- Researching OpenRouter API documentation
- Finding examples of audio processing implementations
- Investigating competitor features
- Gathering UI/UX patterns from similar apps

**Best practices for nano-grazynka:**
```
# Scrape OpenRouter pricing for cost optimization
firecrawl.scrape("https://openrouter.ai/pricing")

# Research To-Doist UI patterns
firecrawl.scrape("https://todoist.com/features")
```

## üß™ Testing Servers

### 8. Puppeteer (E2E Testing)
**When to use:**
- Testing file upload flows
- Verifying transcription status updates
- Checking export functionality
- Validating search/filter features

**Test scenarios for nano-grazynka:**
```javascript
// Test voice note upload
puppeteer.navigate("http://localhost:3100")
puppeteer.fill("#file-input", "test-audio.mp3")
puppeteer.click("#upload-btn")
puppeteer.wait_for("Processing complete")

// Test reprocessing
puppeteer.click(".voice-note-item")
puppeteer.click("#reprocess-btn")
puppeteer.screenshot("reprocessing-state")
```

## üìã Workflow Patterns

### Feature Development Workflow
1. **Research** with Perplexity (latest practices)
2. **Plan** with Sequential Thinking (architecture)
3. **Explore** with Serena (codebase navigation)
4. **Document** with Memory (decisions/patterns)
5. **Reference** with Context7 (framework docs)
6. **Implement** using native tools
7. **Test** with Puppeteer (E2E scenarios)
8. **Commit** with GitHub (version control)

### Bug Investigation Workflow
1. **Analyze** with Serena (find relevant code)
2. **Think** with Sequential Thinking (root cause)
3. **Research** with Perplexity (known issues)
4. **Fix** using native tools
5. **Test** with Puppeteer
6. **Track** with GitHub (issue/PR)

### Performance Optimization Workflow
1. **Profile** with native tools
2. **Research** with Perplexity (optimization techniques)
3. **Plan** with Sequential Thinking (approach)
4. **Document** with Memory (baseline metrics)
5. **Implement** improvements
6. **Verify** with tests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Prefer Native Tools When:
- Reading/writing files (use native Read/Edit/Write)
- Running commands (use native Bash)
- Simple file operations (use native LS/Glob/Grep)

### Use MCP Servers When:
- You need intelligent code analysis (Serena)
- You need persistent context (Memory)
- You need documentation (Context7)
- You need research (Perplexity/Firecrawl)
- You need complex reasoning (Sequential Thinking)
- You need version control (GitHub)
- You need browser automation (Puppeteer)

### Resource Efficiency Tips:
1. Use Serena's symbolic tools instead of reading entire files
2. Cache Context7 documentation lookups in Memory
3. Batch GitHub operations when possible
4. Reuse Puppeteer sessions for multiple tests
5. Store Perplexity research findings in Memory
