# Frontend-Backend Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Environment Setup ✅
- Created `.env` file with API key placeholders
- Created `/data/uploads` directory structure
- Added environment variables for frontend/backend communication

### Phase 2: API Alignment ✅
- Fixed upload endpoint (`/api/voice-notes/upload` → `/api/voice-notes`)
- Updated export to handle blob responses
- Added metadata support to upload function
- Made API client baseUrl public for export functionality

### Phase 3: Docker Configuration ✅
- Added Docker network for container communication
- Fixed environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL for client, API_URL_INTERNAL for server)
- Created `next.config.js` for proper environment handling
- Added startup script (`start.sh`) for easier deployment

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ✅
- Created comprehensive README with setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting guide
- Documented all commands and configuration

### Phase 5: Final Adjustments ✅
- Updated `.gitignore` for better security
- Added proper file structure documentation
- Created this integration summary

## How to Run

1. **Add your API key to `.env`**:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3100
   - Backend: http://localhost:3101

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
- `/frontend/lib/api/voiceNotes.ts`: Fixed upload endpoint and export functionality
- `/frontend/lib/api/client.ts`: Made baseUrl public
- `/frontend/next.config.js`: Added for environment configuration

### Backend Changes
- Docker networking configured
- CORS properly set up
- Multipart form handling ready

### Infrastructure Changes
- `docker-compose.yml`: Added network configuration
- `.env`: Created with API key placeholders
- `start.sh`: Added startup script
- `README.md`: Complete documentation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Docker services start successfully
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3100
- [ ] Backend health check passes at http://localhost:3101/health
- [ ] File upload works (requires valid API key)
- [ ] Processing completes (requires valid API key)
- [ ] Library page loads and displays notes
- [ ] Detail page shows transcription and summary
- [ ] Export to Markdown/JSON works
- [ ] Search and filters work

## Next Steps

1. Add your actual API key to `.env`
2. Run `./start.sh` to start the application
3. Test all functionality
4. Monitor logs with `docker compose logs -f`

## Important Notes

- The application requires either an OpenAI or OpenRouter API key to function
- File uploads are limited to 500MB
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, WebM, MP4
- Data is stored locally in SQLite database
- Uploaded files are stored in `/data/uploads`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Ensure Docker has enough resources
4. Check file permissions on `/data` directory
