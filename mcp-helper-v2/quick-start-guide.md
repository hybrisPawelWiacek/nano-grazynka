# MCP Helper V2 - Quick Start Guide

> **Note**: This guide has been integrated into [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which is now the primary instruction file for MCP-Helper V2. Please refer to CLAUDE.md for the most up-to-date information and conversation options.

## Migration Notice

The content from this quick-start guide has been moved to CLAUDE.md to follow the new project organization pattern where:
- **CLAUDE.md** serves as the main instruction file for Claude Code
- **README.md** provides project overview for humans
- **Playbooks/** contain detailed conversation workflows

## How to Access

When MCP-Helper V2 is cloned into your project, start with:
> "There is a CLAUDE.md file in mcp-helper-v2, tell me what options I have"

Or simply:
> "Show me the MCP-Helper V2 options"

## Quick Reference

**Playbook**: [Exclude MCP Servers](playbooks/exclude-mcp-servers.md)  
**For**: When you have global MCP servers but want to exclude specific ones from a project  
**What I'll do**: Guide you through environment variable exclusion with wrapper scripts  
**Example**: Disable claude-code MCP to use native tools only

### ü§ñ Subagent Configuration (NEW!)

#### 6. "I want to create a specialized subagent"
**Playbook**: [Create Subagent](playbooks/create-subagent.md)  
**For**: Building custom AI assistants with specific expertise and MCP protocols  
**What I'll do**: Design a subagent with optimal MCP server selection for its role  
**Example**: Create a security-auditor with read-only GitHub access and Perplexity for CVE research

#### 7. "I need to optimize MCP protocols for my agents"
**Playbook**: [Configure MCP Protocols](playbooks/configure-mcp-protocols.md)  
**For**: Improving performance by optimizing tool hierarchies and fallback chains  
**What I'll do**: Analyze agent usage patterns and create efficient MCP server protocols  
**Example**: Configure a backend-architect to prioritize Serena over Grep for 3x faster symbol lookup

#### 8. "I want to assemble a team of subagents"
**Playbook**: [Assemble Subagent Team](playbooks/assemble-subagent-team.md)  
**For**: Complex projects requiring coordinated multi-agent workflows  
**What I'll do**: Build a complete AI development team with optimal coordination patterns  
**Team Patterns**:
- **Role-Based**: backend-architect, frontend-developer, qa-tester (like a real dev team)
- **Technology-Based**: python-pro, react-expert, postgres-specialist (by tech stack)
- **Hierarchical**: tech-lead ‚Üí specialists ‚Üí workers (enterprise patterns)

#### 9. "Import agents from community repositories"
**Playbook**: Import Existing Agents  
**For**: Leveraging proven subagents from repositories like lst97, wshobson, vijaythecoder  
**What I'll do**: Import, enhance with MCP protocols, and integrate into your workflow  
**Popular Collections**:
- lst97: 33 specialized agents for full SDLC
- wshobson: 61 agents with model-based optimization
- vijaythecoder: 24 framework-specific specialists

## Subagent Quick Examples

### Create a Code Review Team
```
"Assemble a code review team with security focus"
‚Üí Creates: code-reviewer (Serena, GitHub) + security-auditor (GitHub read-only, Perplexity) + performance-optimizer (Sequential Thinking)
```

### Build a Full-Stack Development Team
```
"Create a team for building a SaaS application"
‚Üí Creates: backend-architect + frontend-developer + database-optimizer + devops-engineer + qa-tester
```

### Optimize Existing Agent
```
"My Python agent is slow at finding code"
‚Üí Optimizes: Replaces Read/Grep with Serena for 60% speed improvement
```

## What I'll Need From You

During our conversation, I'll ask questions like:
- What type of project are you working on?
- Which capabilities do you need? (e.g., code analysis, web search, API access)
- Do you want global or project-specific configurations?
- For subagents: What's their primary role? Security restrictions?
- For teams: Role-based or technology-based organization?

## Project Structure

After our conversation, your project will have:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.mcp                 # Your project-specific secrets (git-ignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-mcp-env.sh        # Launch script with environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                # Instructions for future Claude sessions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/              # Your custom subagents (if created)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-architect.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-auditor.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team-manifest.yaml
```

And if configuring globally:
```
~/.claude.json               # Global MCP server configurations
~/.claude-env                # Global environment variables
~/.claude/agents/            # Global subagent definitions
```

## Foundation Servers for Advanced Features

For subagent configuration and novel server research, ensure these are configured:
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex reasoning and planning
- **Perplexity**: Deep research capabilities
- **Memory**: Persistent context management
- **Serena**: Semantic code understanding
- **Context7**: Up-to-date documentation

## Ready?

Just tell me what you'd like to configure! Examples:
- "I want to set up MCP servers for a new React project"
- "Help me create a backend development subagent"
- "I need a team of agents for my microservices project"
- "Import the security-auditor from lst97's collection"
- "Optimize my frontend agent's MCP protocols"

If this is your first time, I'll start by asking about your interaction preferences. Otherwise, I'll use your saved preferences from CLAUDE.md to guide you through the process with your preferred verbosity, tone, and depth.

**Important**: This guide is now maintained in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Please refer to that file for the latest instructions and conversation options. The CLAUDE.md file provides Claude Code with the full context of MCP-Helper V2's capabilities when the project is cloned into your host project.
