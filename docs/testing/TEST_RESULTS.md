## Current Issues (UPDATED)

### ✅ FIXED Issue #1: Processing Pipeline (RESOLVED as of 14:37)
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Resolution**: ProcessVoiceNoteUseCase errors resolved, Whisper API working
- **Test Result**: Full pipeline working end-to-end

### Issue #2: API Response Missing Data
- **Test ID**: B2.6
- **Severity**: P1 - HIGH
- **Error**: GET /api/voice-notes/:id returns undefined for transcription/summary
- **Impact**: Frontend cannot display transcription or summary content
- **Root Cause**: Data is saved to DB but not included in API response
- **Fix Needed**: Update GetVoiceNoteUseCase to include relations

## Environment Issues

### Missing Dependencies
- Node test scripts missing `form-data` module
- Python scripts work correctly
- Solution: Use Python tests or install npm dependencies

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (P1)
1. ✅ **Processing Pipeline** - FIXED
   - Whisper API working (~5-6 seconds)
   - GPT-4 summarization working
   - Full pipeline operational

2. ❗ **Fix API Response Data**
   - Update GetVoiceNoteUseCase to include relations
   - Ensure transcription/summary returned in response

### Ready to Continue
- Backend processing works ✅
- Can proceed with Suite 3-6 testing
- Frontend integration pending

## Recommendations (UPDATED)

1. **Fix API response** to include transcription/summary data
2. **Connect frontend** to backend API (Step 7)
3. **Run E2E tests** with Playwright MCP
4. **Complete remaining test suites** (3-6)
5. **Document actual LLM prompts** being used in the system
