### Previous Phase: ✅ Unified Multi-Model Transcription COMPLETE
**Progress: 100%** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Plan**: [UNIFIED_TRANSCRIPTION_PLAN.md](./imp_docs/archive/UNIFIED_TRANSCRIPTION_PLAN.md)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 2)

#### Day 1 - UI Components (100%)
- ✅ Created AdvancedOptions component with collapsible whisper prompt field
- ✅ Created PostTranscriptionDialog for post-transcription summary customization
- ✅ Updated PreviewDialog to integrate AdvancedOptions
- ✅ Created CSS modules for all new components

#### Day 2 - Integration (100%)

- ✅ Wrote comprehensive Playwright E2E tests (7 test scenarios)

### ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

**1. File Path Resolution**
- **Fix**: LocalStorageAdapter now returns full path instead of just filename
- **Status**: ✅ Working - files are found correctly

**2. FormData Issue**
- **Problem**: Legacy form-data npm package incompatible with fetch()
- **Fix**: Replaced with native FormData and Blob APIs (Node.js 18+)
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**3. Model Configuration**
- **Problem**: Using whisper-1 instead of gpt-4o-transcribe
- **Fix**: Updated config.yaml to use gpt-4o-transcribe
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**4. Response Format**
- **Problem**: gpt-4o-transcribe doesn't support 'verbose_json'
- **Fix**: Use 'json' for gpt-4o models, 'verbose_json' for whisper
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**5. LLMAdapter Parameters**
- **Problem**: Wrong method signature in ProcessingOrchestrator
- **Fix**: Corrected summarize() call to use (text, language, options)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed but summarization still failing

### ✅ Summarization Fixed (2025-08-12)

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **LLMAdapter getSystemPrompt**: Fixed to use `prompts.summary` directly instead of language-specific keys
2. **ProcessingOrchestrator**: Cleaned up unused variables and fixed prompt passing
3. **API Key Loading**: ~~Added fallback to process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY~~ 
4. **Gemini Compatibility**: Added explicit JSON format instructions for Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
5. **Session Header Support**: Fixed upload endpoint to accept x-session-id header
6. **OpenRouter API Key Fix (Critical)**: Fixed ConfigLoader to select correct API key based on provider
   - Root cause: ConfigLoader was using OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenRouter requests
   - Solution: Modified mergeWithEnv() to check provider type before selecting API key
   - Impact: OpenRouter now correctly receives OPENROUTER_API_KEY

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Transcription working with gpt-4o-transcribe
- ✅ Summarization working with google/gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter
- ✅ Two-pass transcription Phase 2 complete
- ✅ API key configuration fixed for multi-provider support

### ✅ Phase 3: Unified Multi-Model Transcription (✅ COMPLETE - 2025-08-13)

- ✅ Both API integration paths tested and working

#### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Day 4) ✅
- ✅ Fixed test-multi-model.js script (native FormData, field naming)
- ✅ Created comprehensive E2E tests (10 test scenarios)
- ✅ Tested both GPT-4o and Gemini paths successfully
- ✅ Token validation and cost estimation verified
- ⏭️ Skipped: LLM refinement for GPT-4o (low priority)
