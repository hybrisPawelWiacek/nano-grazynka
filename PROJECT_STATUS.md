### 🎨 UI/UX Issues (Poor User Experience)
**Entity Management**:
- 🔴 EntityManager buried in Settings page (hard to find)
- 🔴 No search/filter for entities

- 🔴 Can't delete projects
- 🔴 No project statistics (notes count, entities count)

**Integration Flow**:
- 🔴 Entity-project relationship not obvious to users

### 🚨 Critical Path to MVP
1. **MUST HAVE** (Week 1):
   - Entity-project linking UI
   - Entity context injection into prompts
   - Entity pills display
   - Basic project management

2. **SHOULD HAVE** (Week 2):
   - Dedicated entity/project pages
   - Search and filter
   - Usage statistics
   - Onboarding flow

3. **NICE TO HAVE** (Future):
   - Templates and examples
   - Import/export
   - Drag-and-drop
   - Keyboard shortcuts

### 📊 Current Implementation Status
- **Backend API**: 90% complete (missing context injection)
- **Frontend UI**: 40% complete (missing critical linking features)
- **User Experience**: 20% (poor discoverability and usability)
- **Overall System**: 40% functional (foundation exists, critical features missing)

**Bottom Line**: The entity system foundation is built but not connected. Without entity-project linking UI and context injection, the system cannot deliver its core value proposition of improving transcription accuracy through domain-specific vocabulary.

- ✅ Unified testing strategy aligned with TEST_PLAN.md mandate  

### Latest Updates

#### ✅ Database Migration System Fixed (2025-08-17)
**Permanent Solution to Prisma Path Confusion**:
- ✅ **Root Cause Discovered**: Prisma has documented bug #27212 with SQLite relative paths
  - Relative paths fail with "P1003: Database does not exist" even when file exists
  - Prisma resolves paths from process working directory, not schema location
  - This caused 4 different databases to be created in various locations
- ✅ **Three-Layer Defense Solution**:
  1. **Fixed npm scripts**: Removed escaped quotes, use `$PWD` for absolute paths
  2. **Directory guards**: Added backend/backend/ navigation prevention to CLAUDE.md
  3. **Clear documentation**: Documented Prisma bug and working solutions
- ✅ **Implementation Details**:
  - Updated backend/package.json with working npm scripts using `DATABASE_URL=file:$PWD/../data/nano-grazynka.db`
  - All Prisma commands now use npm scripts: `npm run migrate:dev`, `migrate:deploy`, `migrate:status`, etc.
  - Added comprehensive database rules to CLAUDE.md with forbidden directory patterns
  - Verified migration tracking with _prisma_migrations table
- ✅ **Result**: Single source of truth at `./data/nano-grazynka.db`, no more path confusion possible

#### ✅ Database Consolidation Complete (2025-08-16)
**Fixed Multiple Database Files Issue**:
- ✅ **Root Cause**: Claude Code's `.claude/settings.local.json` was auto-approving commands with hardcoded DATABASE_URL paths
- ✅ **Impact**: Created 4 different SQLite databases in various locations
- ✅ **Solution Implemented**:
  - Consolidated all databases into single file at `./data/nano-grazynka.db`
  - Created `scripts/prisma-helper.sh` for automatic path detection
  - Removed 17 hardcoded DATABASE_URL commands from settings.local.json
  - Replaced with generic pattern `Bash(DATABASE_URL=* npx prisma*)`
- ✅ **Prevention Measures**:
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with critical database rules and warnings
  - Helper script ensures correct path based on context (Docker/host/backend)
  - Single source of truth for database location
- ✅ **Result**: Entity Project System tables successfully applied to correct database

#### ✅ Rate Limiting & Usage Counter Fixes (2025-08-16)
**Fixed Critical Issues for Anonymous Users**:

- ✅ Solution: Added nested objects (flat.entities, flat.project, flat.user) alongside flat keys
- ✅ Result: Prompts now correctly load from backend/prompts.yaml with working variable interpolation
- ✅ Verified: No more "ReferenceError: entities is not defined" errors in production

#### ✅ Header Component Unification Complete (2025-08-16)
**Consistent Navigation Across All Pages**:

- ✅ Single source of truth for header styling and behavior
- ✅ Improved maintainability and consistency

#### ✅ Library Page 401 Error Fixed - Third Attempt (2025-08-15)
**Root Cause Analysis and Comprehensive Fix**:

### Previous Phase: ✅ Unified Multi-Model Transcription COMPLETE
**Progress: 100%** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Plan**: [UNIFIED_TRANSCRIPTION_PLAN.md](./imp_docs/archive/UNIFIED_TRANSCRIPTION_PLAN.md)

### ✅ Completed (Phase 2)

#### Day 1 - UI Components (100%)

### ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

**1. File Path Resolution**
- **Fix**: LocalStorageAdapter now returns full path instead of just filename
- **Status**: ✅ Working - files are found correctly

**2. FormData Issue**
- **Problem**: Legacy form-data npm package incompatible with fetch()
- **Fix**: Replaced with native FormData and Blob APIs (Node.js 18+)
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**3. Model Configuration**
- **Problem**: Using whisper-1 instead of gpt-4o-transcribe
- **Fix**: Updated config.yaml to use gpt-4o-transcribe
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**4. Response Format**
- **Problem**: gpt-4o-transcribe doesn't support 'verbose_json'
- **Fix**: Use 'json' for gpt-4o models, 'verbose_json' for whisper
- **Status**: ✅ Working

**5. LLMAdapter Parameters**
- **Problem**: Wrong method signature in ProcessingOrchestrator
- **Fix**: Corrected summarize() call to use (text, language, options)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed but summarization still failing

### ✅ Summarization Fixed (2025-08-12)

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **LLMAdapter getSystemPrompt**: Fixed to use `prompts.summary` directly instead of language-specific keys
2. **ProcessingOrchestrator**: Cleaned up unused variables and fixed prompt passing
3. **API Key Loading**: ~~Added fallback to process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY~~ 
4. **Gemini Compatibility**: Added explicit JSON format instructions for Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
5. **Session Header Support**: Fixed upload endpoint to accept x-session-id header
6. **OpenRouter API Key Fix (Critical)**: Fixed ConfigLoader to select correct API key based on provider
   - Root cause: ConfigLoader was using OPENAI_API_KEY for OpenRouter requests
   - Solution: Modified mergeWithEnv() to check provider type before selecting API key
   - Impact: OpenRouter now correctly receives OPENROUTER_API_KEY

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Transcription working with gpt-4o-transcribe
- ✅ Summarization working with google/gemini-2.5-flash via OpenRouter
- ✅ Two-pass transcription Phase 2 complete

- ✅ Created comprehensive E2E tests (10 test scenarios)
- ✅ Tested both GPT-4o and Gemini paths successfully
- ✅ Token validation and cost estimation verified
- ⏭️ Skipped: LLM refinement for GPT-4o (low priority)
