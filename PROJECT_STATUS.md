## üîÑ Proposed UX Rearchitecture

### Current Issue
- Users are greeted with login page first
- Cannot see app capabilities without account
- Poor conversion flow (barrier before value)

### Proposed Solution
- **Public Homepage**: Show full app with upload capability
- **Anonymous Usage**: Allow 5 free transcriptions without account
- **Graceful Upgrade**: Prompt for account after seeing value
- **Classic SaaS Pattern**: Try ‚Üí Love ‚Üí Sign up

### Implementation Scope
1. Remove homepage from protected routes in middleware
2. Support anonymous uploads with session tracking
3. Convert to account after transcription limit
4. Show benefits of creating account inline

## üìã Next Steps (Post-MVP)

### High Priority
1. **UX Rearchitecture**
   - Public homepage with anonymous usage
   - Session-based tracking for non-logged users
   - Conversion flow after usage limit

2. **Production Deployment**
   - PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
   - Environment-specific configs
   - SSL/TLS setup

### Medium Priority
3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Batch upload support
   - Real-time processing updates (WebSockets)
   - Advanced search and filtering

4. **Performance**
   - Redis caching layer
   - Background job queue
   - CDN for static assets

### Low Priority
5. **Polish**
   - Better error messages
   - Loading skeletons
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Dark mode
